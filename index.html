    <h4>Departing Plight</h4>
    <p>
      <b class="first-letter">O</b>ften weighed down with pounds of luggage, migrants devoted themselves to reaching the
      “promised land." High hopes for better work and prosperity spurred on the mass movement of
      African-Americans from the south to the north and west. Black travelers en masse hit the road in search of better
      opportunities and the escape of oppression. On one-way tickets and cautious itineraries, black migrants were
      pioneering paths refused to them by deep-seated racism
    </p>

    <p>The majority of African-Americans living in the south were impoverished under debt bondage. In 1930, only ten
      percent of southern blacks worked on land that they owned.<sup class="citation">2</sup> Extreme poverty was
      rampant in southern black communities.<sup class="citation">3</sup> One black sharecropper wrote: “The
      conditions are horrible here with us. they wont give us anyhing to do & say that we wont need anything but
      something to eat & wont give us anything for what we do & wants us to stay here.”<sup class="citation">4</sup>
      Under the sharecropping system
      African-Americans were living destitute lives of servitude with meagre pay. Child labor was commonplace in black
      communities. In many cases black families depended on child labor. A tenant farmer from Georgia recalled that the
      “[only] reason families survived they put their money together … five or six of us children that were working and
      all of us were working for twenty-five cents a day,”<sup class="citation">5</sup> Migrants were leaving lives of
      laborious poverty determined
      by institutional racial discrimination.</p>


    <p>Other African-Americans fled the south from persecution, and racial terror. Pervasive lynchings, murders, and
      violent threats compelled a number of migrants to travel in search of refuge. Between 1877 and 1950, over 4,000
      lynchings of African-Americans occurred in the south.<sup class="citation">6</sup> Victims would be hanged,
      burned, and
      tortured in consequence of minor
      offenses and dubious rumors.<sup class="citation">7</sup> When African-Americans spoke out against injustice they
      risked being murdered. For instance, in 1918, Elton Mitchell, a black farmer from Arkansas who refused to work
      without pay, was butchered by resentful whites.<sup class="citation">8</sup> Such killings continued for decades.
      Racial terror was an
      inescapable reality for
      blacks
      continuing to live in the south. Thus, many African-Americans looked towards the "promised land" and took on
      travel to find refuge. </p>

    <p>Whether employment or refuge were the ambitions of individual migrants, all black migrants ultimately shared a
      common experience of traveling with the weight of social exclusion. Color was the determining factor in the
      comfort
      and convenience of their travels.</p>

    <h5>The Enduring Paths of Black Travelers</h5>
    <p> Under the constraints of Jim Crow, black travelers had to navigate their way
      out of the south
      with great discretion. De jure and de facto racism placed substantial roadblocks in the paths of blacks fleeing
      oppression. Limited access to services such as accommodation, transportation, dining and health facilities imposed
      a great challenge onto African-American travelers. Many migrants were dependent upon word of mouth to find the
      nearest place to stay.<sup class="citation">10</sup> Hotels were frequently unavailable to black
      travelers.<sup class="citation">11</sup> African-Americans were also subjected to
      inconvenient transportation services. Segregated transportation often confined black travelers to congested
      stations and vehicles. The service of black passengers came second to that of their white counterparts.
      In Benjamin E. May’s recount of his travels, Mays stated that: “Usually the segregated window to serve Negroes was
      neglected as long as white people were waiting to be served on the
      other side.”<sup class="citation">12</sup> As a result, black ticket lines were regularly left under-served.<sup
        class="citation">13</sup>
      Such neglect of black passengers reflected white society’s
      unabashed disregard for black travelers.

    <p>Throughout the Great Migration, migrants faced arduous journeys across the far-flung reaches of the country. Long
      haul travel was the common mode of transit for blacks fleeing the south. Black train passengers spent hours or
      even days crammed with the discomfort of Jim Crow cars.<sup class="citation">14</sup> Passengers in Jim Crow cars
      were congested into smoke-filled cars
      with little access to water for extended periods of time.<sup class="citation">15</sup> For miles black travelers
      endured the harsh conditions of jam-packed train rides with poor-ventilation and sweltering engine heat.<sup
        class="citation">16</sup> Migrants had no choice but to put their
      faith in the precarious
      train-cars that were purposefully neglected. The railroads served as key passageways for early migrants travelling
      to northern and western cities such as Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago.<sup class="citation">17</sup>
      With great perseverance, black
      migrants trailblazed their way to freedom, no matter the taxing toll of institutional racism.


    <p>The itineraries of black travelers were subject to boundless inconveniences specifically targeting them on the
      basis of color and race. African-American travelers commonly had to factor in the nuisance of southern law
      enforcement cracking down on black migration.“To circumvent authorities, African
      Americans might buy tickets to
      smaller stations—which were not so heavily guarded, and where they were less likely to be recognized—and there
      purchase the fare to their final destination.”<sup class="citation">18</sup> Jim Crow complicated the routes of
      black travelers
      with unnecessary
      layovers, stopovers and train-tickets. All while on a limited budget. “They might also walk many miles to such
      stations.”<sup class="citation">19</sup> Black
      travelers were
      forced off the beaten path just to guarantee the safety of their travels. Otherwise, they could find themselves
      with hefty delays, abrupt cancellations, harassment, or even detainment. For instance, one train leaving
      Brookhaven, Mississippi with 125 black migrants was delayed for three days.<sup class="citation">20</sup> Other
      incidents involved black passengers being snatched off of trains; as one black man told <i>Journal of Negro
        History</i> in 1919, "in spite of all this,
      they are leaving every day and every night."<sup class="citation">21</sup> The travel plans of
      African-Americans
      in the Great
      Migration were tenuous to the overbearing grasp of Jim Crow.</p>

    <h6>Persistence to Enter "the Promised Land"</h6>
    <p>Given the uncertainty of travel as an African-American, a series of travel guides called <i>The Green
        Books</i>
      debuted in 1936 to cater to black travelers and their needs. Their books provided information that could help
      streamline the itineraries of migrants as they move their way through foreign towns. The three main priorities of
      <i>The Green Books</i> were to keep black travelers from “running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make
      his trips
      more enjoyable.”<sup class="citation">22</sup> Not only were unexpected mishaps taxing on black travelers but also
      the humiliation in segregated
      spaces.<i>The Green Books</i> were a medium in which black journalism helped support black travelers as they face
      discrimination and humiliation on the road. By advertising specific restaurants and accommodations that
      accepted black patrons, <i>The Green Books</i> were guiding the African-American migrant community with
      compassionate
      precaution. In addition, the guides included tips on preparing travel, such as the page in the 1937 edition
      advising extra precautions for motorists.<sup class="citation">23</sup> From an excerpt of the 1949 edition of The
      Green Book, the company made a statement regarding the nature of their business:
    </p>
    <p class="quote"> <em>There will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published.
        That
        is when we as
        a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to
        suspend
        this publication for then we can go wherever we please, and without embarrassment. But until that time comes we
        shall continue to publish this information for your convenience each year.</em><sup class="citation">24</sup>
    </p>

    <p>Their publications were an essential service for insuring that more African-Americans travelling north would have
      the know-how required for their harsh journeys. </p>


    <p>Despite many hardships, travel was a liberating force for African-Americans. The resilient pursuit of freedom by
      migrants settled them into the workforce, urban communities and redefined their place in American society.
      African-American migrants ventured into the unknown in an attempt to find autonomy over their own lives, whether
      that meant finding safety or financial stability. Though the Jim Crow system was a national issue, the courageous
      steps taken by migrants out of the south were significant steps toward black liberation. </p>
